## server.js
 1. **Code Quality and Best Practices:**
   - Consider using ESLint for enforcing consistent coding styles and catching potential errors. You can install it via `npm install eslint` and configure a .eslintrc.json file.
   - Make use of async/await functions consistently throughout the codebase. While you are already using them in AI API Integrations section, they could be used more consistently for the route handlers as well.
   - Add comments to explain complex parts of the code or reasons behind certain design decisions.

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Limit the number of tokens returned from each AI API call. Currently, you are setting `max_tokens: 500` for all calls. Depending on the complexity of the queries and responses, this might not be necessary for every request. Reducing the number of tokens could help improve performance.
   - Consider using a caching mechanism to store API responses temporarily. This can help reduce the number of API calls when similar requests are made.

3. **Security Issues:**
   - While you are already using helmet and rate limiting, consider using other security middlewares such as express-session for handling user sessions securely and compressing responses with a package like compression to reduce server response size.
   - Ensure that the API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, GROK_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY) are not committed to version control systems. Instead, store them as environment variables or use a secrets management service like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.

4. **Documentation Improvements:**
   - Document the usage of your API in a separate file (README.md or documentation.md) including examples for different use cases and available parameters.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to set up, run, test, and debug the server locally.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities:**
   - Create separate modules for each API integration (callOpenAI, callGrok, callClaude) so they can be easily tested and reused in other parts of your application if needed.
   - Instead of hardcoding the AI model names in the code, consider passing them as parameters to make it easier to switch between models or add new ones.
   - Split the server logic into smaller, more manageable modules for better maintainability and testability. For example, you can have separate files for route handlers, middleware, configurations, etc.
