## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use TypeScript for better type safety and IDE support. You can install it using `npm install typescript --save` and update the `tsconfig.json` file according to your project needs.
   - Consider using ESLint for enforcing consistent coding styles across your team. Install it with `npm install eslint --save-dev`, create a `.eslintrc.json` file, and configure rules as per your preference.
   - Implement proper error handling throughout the codebase, not just in the main bridge endpoint. For example, you can use try-catch blocks for fetch calls to handle potential errors gracefully.
   - Add comments for better understanding of the code, especially for complex parts or when relying on external APIs.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Reduce API call latency by implementing a caching mechanism for responses from OpenAI, Grok, and Claude. You can store responses in-memory or use a data storage solution like Redis or Memcached.
   - Consider using server-side rendering (SSR) to improve initial page load times for the UI that interacts with this API.
   - Monitor the server's performance using tools like New Relic or AppDynamics to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

3. Security Issues:
   - While you already have rate limiting, consider implementing additional security measures such as input validation (sanitize user input to prevent potential attacks), HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) for enforcing HTTPS connections, and XSS protection.
   - Keep your dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.
   - Consider using a library like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication if multiple users will interact with this API.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write comprehensive documentation on how to use the API, including examples and potential edge cases. This can help developers integrate your API more easily.
   - Add clear instructions on setting up and running the server locally for development purposes.
   - Include a README file explaining project objectives, technology stack, and any important information relevant to contributors or users.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract functions related to API calls into their own module to keep the server file cleaner and easier to maintain.
   - Consider using async/await for a cleaner and more readable way of handling promises throughout your codebase.
   - Separate environment-specific configurations (like API keys) into dedicated files or use `dotenv-safe` package instead of the default `dotenv`.
