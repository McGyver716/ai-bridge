## server.js
 1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
   - Use `async/await` consistently for fetching API responses. The current code mixes `async/await` with `Promise.allSettled()`.
   - Consider using a more robust error handling strategy. You can create custom errors or use a library like `express-async-errors`.
   - Follow the style guide for JavaScript (e.g., Airbnb, Google) to ensure consistent coding standards.

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduce the number of API calls per request. Currently, the code fetches responses from all AI providers when 'all' is specified. Consider implementing pagination or lazy loading if possible.
   - Cache the API responses for faster subsequent requests. Implement a caching mechanism to store and retrieve responses from memory or a database.
   - Use gzip compression for smaller response sizes and faster delivery, especially for JSON data.

3. **Security Issues**
   - The current code is using hardcoded API keys in the environment variables. This should be avoided as it can expose sensitive information. Consider using environmental variables management services like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage your API keys.
   - Implement input validation for all endpoints, especially the `/ai-bridge` endpoint that handles user queries. Validate the query parameter length and format to prevent potential security risks.
   - Add a more robust CORS policy to avoid Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues and enhance security.

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Write clear, concise, and up-to-date documentation for the API endpoints, including examples of correct usage and error handling scenarios.
   - Document any assumptions made when developing the codebase, as well as known limitations or trade-offs.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Extract common logic into separate modules to improve modularity and maintainability. For example, create a separate module for making API calls, another for error handling, etc.
   - Use TypeScript for type safety, improved autocompletion in IDEs, and better tooling support.
   - Split the `server.js` file into smaller files organized by functionality (e.g., middleware, routes, API integrations).
