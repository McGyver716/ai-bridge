## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all API calls to improve readability and error handling.
   - Consider using a linting tool like ESLint to enforce consistent coding style across the project.
   - Add type declarations (TypeScript) for better type safety, which can help catch potential errors early.
   - Use camelCase for variable names to follow JavaScript naming conventions. For example: `openAIAPICall` instead of `callOpenAI`.
   - Consider using a logging library like Winston for more structured and centralized logging.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache the API responses from OpenAI, Grok, and Claude (if their responses don't change frequently) to reduce network requests and improve performance.
   - Implement response compression by adding `app.use(compression())` to compress the outgoing responses.
   - Lazy-load or load on-demand the AI API integration functions if they are not used frequently, as this can help reduce server startup time.

3. Security Issues:
   - Make sure the API keys for OpenAI, Grok, and Claude are stored securely (e.g., in an encrypted configuration file or environment variables that are not committed to version control).
   - Consider using additional security middleware like Morgan for logging requests, which can help with debugging and auditing purposes.
   - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to ensure the application is served over HTTPS only, helping prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add detailed comments for each function explaining its purpose, input parameters, and output values.
   - Create an API documentation page with clear instructions on how to use the AI Bridge, including examples and supported query parameters.
   - Provide a README file that includes installation, configuration, and usage instructions for the project.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract the common logic between `callOpenAI`, `callGrok`, and `callClaude` into a helper function to improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.
   - Consider using a third-party library like Axios for making API requests, as it provides additional features like request cancellation and retry logic.
   - Create middleware functions for each of the AI services (OpenAI, Grok, Claude) to encapsulate the rate limiting and security middleware for easier management and reuse.
   - Separate the health check endpoint into its own file, as it doesn't require any specific dependencies or setup. This can improve modularity and make the server file cleaner.
