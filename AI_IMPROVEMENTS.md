## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently throughout the code for more readability and easier error handling. For example, in the main bridge endpoint, you can refactor it as follows:
     ```
     app.get('/ai-bridge', async (req, res) => { ... });
     ```
   - Consider using ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style and catch potential errors early. You can install it via npm:
     ```
     npm install eslint --save-dev
     ```
   - Use descriptive variable names for better readability, for example: `OPENAI_API_KEY` instead of `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Use a caching mechanism to reduce API calls, especially if the responses are not expected to change frequently. You can use libraries like Redis or Memcached for this purpose.
   - Use gzip compression to minimize the size of HTTP responses and speed up data transfer. This can be enabled with middleware like `compression`.
     ```
     const compression = require('compression');
     app.use(compression());
     ```

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate user input thoroughly to prevent potential attacks, such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). For example, validate the `query` parameter in the main bridge endpoint.
   - Use secure methods like `https` for all API requests. Ensure that your server is using HTTPS by configuring an SSL certificate.
   - To further secure your server against common attacks, consider using additional middleware such as `express-session`, `hsts`, and `xss-clean`.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add a README file that explains the purpose of the project, its dependencies, installation instructions, usage examples, and API documentation.
   - Include a CONTRIBUTING file to guide others on how they can contribute to your project.
   - Document all endpoints in an easily accessible location (e.g., swagger or Postman collection).

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality like API calls into separate functions for better organization and reusability. This will make the code easier to maintain and extend in the future.
   - Create a middleware function that handles rate limiting and security checks, so they can be applied to all endpoints consistently.
   - Consider using a more robust framework or microservice architecture if the project grows significantly in size or complexity. This could help manage dependencies and improve scalability.
