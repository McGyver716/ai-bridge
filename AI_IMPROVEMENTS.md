## server.js
 I've analyzed the given code file `server.js` and found several areas for improvement:

1. Code quality and best practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently: Although the main bridge endpoint is using async/await for handling multiple AI API calls, the health check endpoint is not. You can refactor it to be consistent with the main bridge endpoint.
   - Error handling: Add centralized error handling middleware or functions that handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors. This will help in creating a more robust application.
   - Modularize the code: Break up the code into smaller, reusable modules for better organization and maintenance. For example, create separate files for API integrations (OpenAI, Grok, Claude), middleware, and routes.
   - Use `eslint` with a relevant configuration to enforce coding standards and best practices across your project.

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Caching: Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis or Memcached) for frequently accessed data or results from AI APIs. This will help reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.
   - Profiling: Use tools like `chrome-devtools` or `node-visualizer` to profile your application's performance and identify bottlenecks.
   - Lazy loading: Load AI APIs only when needed instead of loading all of them at once, especially if the application has multiple features that don't rely on AI integrations.

3. Security issues:
   - API keys: Store sensitive data like API keys securely using environment variables or a .env file, but never hardcode them directly in your code files.
   - Input validation: Add input validation for the query and AI parameters to prevent malicious requests or unintended errors.
   - Rate limiting: Consider implementing more granular rate limiting based on the user or request type instead of just IP-based rate limiting.
   - Sanitize responses: Ensure that the responses from AI APIs are properly sanitized to prevent any potential security risks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Improve comments and documentation throughout the codebase to make it easier for others to understand your implementation.
   - Add documentation for each endpoint, including examples of valid requests and expected responses.

5. Refactoring opportunities:
   - Separate concerns by creating separate modules or classes for different responsibilities, such as AI integration, middleware, error handling, and routes. This will make the code more modular, easier to test, and simpler to maintain.
   - Use TypeScript to improve type safety and help catch errors early in the development process.
   - Consider using a framework like Fastify or NestJS for better organization, documentation, and built-in features that can help simplify your server implementation.
