## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use ES modules instead of CommonJS for better compatibility and tree shaking. Rename the file to `server.mjs`.
   - Adopt a linting tool like ESLint to ensure consistent code style across your project.
   - Add comments explaining what each function does, especially if it's not immediately clear from its name.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Use request caching when interacting with APIs as long as the data doesn't change often or you can handle stale responses.
   - Consider using a package like `p-rate-limit` for rate limiting, which offers more granular control over limits and retries.
   - Optimize JSON.stringify() calls by using fastjson or similar libraries to improve serialization performance.

3. Security Issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to secure data in transit.
   - Validate input data at the edge (client-side) whenever possible, and never trust user-supplied data.
   - Store sensitive API keys as environment variables and never expose them directly in your code or configuration files. Use libraries like dotenv-secure for safer access to these values.
   - Implement content security policy (CSP) headers for additional security against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write a README file that explains what the project does, how to install and run it, and any other relevant information.
   - Include examples for using your API in the README or provide a separate documentation file.
   - If you plan to make this open-source, consider adding tests, writing clear, concise function descriptions, and following common conventions like JSDoc.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into utility functions to reduce code duplication.
   - Consider using a more opinionated framework like Fastify or Express 4.x for better built-in features and a cleaner API.
   - Use async/await consistently throughout your codebase for easier readability and debugging.
