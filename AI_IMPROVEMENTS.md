## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow JavaScript coding style guides like Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide or StandardJS for consistency across the project.
   - Use descriptive variable names and function names for better readability.
   - Consider using ES6 modules instead of CommonJS (require) to avoid issues with path resolution.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Profile your application using tools like Chrome DevTools or Node.js built-in profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.
   - Use caching mechanisms if appropriate for your use case, such as Redis or Memcached.
   - Minify and compress static assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to reduce their size and improve load times.

3. Security Issues:
   - Ensure that all external libraries are up-to-date and follow best practices for secure coding.
   - Validate user inputs thoroughly before passing them to third-party APIs.
   - Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
   - Consider implementing HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for increased security.
   - Store sensitive data, such as API keys, securely in an environment variable manager like dotenv or Vault. Do not hard-code them directly into your code.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add comprehensive comments and documentation for functions, variables, and modules to make it easier for others to understand the codebase.
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to set up, run, and test the project.
   - Consider adding tests using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to ensure the application works as intended and catch regressions.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into reusable modules to reduce code duplication.
   - Use Promises instead of callbacks for more readable and easier-to-manage asynchronous code.
   - Consider using async/await syntax for cleaner asynchronous code.
   - Organize your codebase by separating concerns into separate files or modules, such as a `utilities` folder containing utility functions.
   - Implement middleware error handling to centralize and manage errors more effectively throughout the application.
