## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `camelCase` for variables instead of `snake_case`. For example, `windowMs`, `max`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.
   - Add type declarations using TypeScript to improve type safety and editor support.
   - Consider adding a linting configuration (e.g., ESLint) to enforce coding standards consistently across the codebase.
   - Use descriptive variable names that accurately represent their purpose. For example, `const limiter = rateLimit({...});` could be renamed to something like `const requestRateLimiter = rateLimit({...});`.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Consider using a library like `node-cache` or Redis for caching API responses to reduce the number of external requests and improve performance.
   - Profile your application using tools like `New Relic`, `Google Chrome DevTools`, or `Node.js built-in profiling features` to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.

3. Security Issues:
   - Ensure that environment variables, such as API keys, are never hardcoded in the source code. Instead, store them securely using tools like AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault.
   - Validate input data carefully to prevent injection attacks and protect against malicious inputs.
   - Implement proper input sanitization for any user-supplied data before passing it to external APIs.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add clear, concise documentation for the API endpoints, including examples of valid requests and responses. This can be done using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.
   - Write comprehensive README file with instructions on setting up, running, testing, and contributing to the project.
   - Document any known limitations, assumptions, or caveats about the application's functionality.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Factor out common code related to API calls (e.g., headers, body formatting) into separate functions for better maintainability and reusability.
   - Consider using an async/await approach instead of Promise.allSettled for handling multiple API calls more cleanly and efficiently.
   - Extract the AI API integrations into a separate module to improve modularity and ease testing.
   - If possible, use HTTPS for all API requests to ensure secure data transmission.
