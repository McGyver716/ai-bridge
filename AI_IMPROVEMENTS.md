## server.js
 I've reviewed your server.js file and identified several areas for improvement in the categories you mentioned:

1. Code quality and best practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently across all your HTTP request handlers to make your code easier to read and maintain. This will also help with error handling since errors are automatically propagated.
   - Add type declarations for your variables and function parameters using TypeScript (ts-node or TypeScript compiler required). This can improve development experience, autocomplete in IDEs, and catch type-related issues at compile time instead of runtime.
   - Use camelCase for function names, variable names, and constants to conform to JavaScript naming conventions. For example, `callOpenAI` could be named `callOpenAi`.
   - Consider using a linter like ESLint with Airbnb style guide (.eslintrc.json) to enforce consistency across your codebase.

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Leverage caching for API responses, especially if the data doesn't change frequently. You can use libraries like Redis or Memcached to store and retrieve cached data efficiently.
   - Optimize the number of calls made to external APIs (OpenAI, Grok, Claude) by limiting the maximum tokens for each AI model based on their pricing tiers if necessary. Also, consider using a rate limiter for each user to avoid overloading the APIs.
   - Consider implementing pagination in your API responses to limit the amount of data sent back to clients, reducing server load and improving performance.

3. Security issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP by obtaining an SSL certificate for your domain and configuring Express to use it. This will encrypt all communication between your server and clients, protecting sensitive information like API keys.
   - Implement proper input validation to prevent injection attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. Sanitize user input before using it in any queries or responses.
   - Protect against DDoS attacks by implementing additional layers of protection like Cloudflare or a WAF (Web Application Firewall).

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Add comprehensive API documentation, including example requests, response formats, and error messages, using tools like Swagger or Postman to make it easy for developers to consume your API.
   - Include usage instructions, setup requirements, and configuration options in the README file of your project repository.

5. Refactoring opportunities:
   - Extract common logic into separate functions to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. For example, you can create a function called `fetchAI` that accepts an API key, model, and query as parameters and handles the request accordingly.
   - Consider implementing a modular structure for your application by splitting it into smaller modules or services, each responsible for a specific functionality (e.g., HealthCheck, AIAPIIntegrations, etc.). This will make it easier to scale and maintain your project over time.

By addressing these suggestions, you can improve the overall quality, performance, security, and documentation of your server.js file while also streamlining the development process for future updates and collaborators.
