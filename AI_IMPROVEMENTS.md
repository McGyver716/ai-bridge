## server.js
 I've analyzed the provided server.js file and here are my suggestions for improvement:

1. Code quality and best practices:
   - Use async/await syntax consistently in all function definitions to improve readability and maintainability of your code. For example, change `Promise.allSettled` to `await Promise.all`.
   - Follow the naming conventions for JavaScript by using camelCase (lowercase first letter of each word, no underscores) for variable names, such as `app`, `limiter`, `results`, etc.
   - Add comments to functions and methods with clear explanations of their purpose and what they do.
   - Consider using ESLint for enforcing a consistent code style and catching potential errors before running the code.

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Caching responses from AI APIs could significantly improve performance as these calls can be expensive. Implement caching strategies depending on your specific use case.
   - Enable gzip compression using middleware (e.g., `compression`) to reduce the size of data sent over the network, improving response times and reducing bandwidth usage.

3. Security issues:
   - In the `callOpenAI` function, ensure that sensitive data like the API key is never exposed in logs or error messages by using a logging library that supports safe strings or configuring your logging library to exclude sensitive information.
   - Consider adding input validation (e.g., sanitize user-supplied data) to prevent potential security risks such as injection attacks.
   - Ensure that the Node.js app is running with non-root privileges to limit potential damage in case of a vulnerability exploitation.

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Add comprehensive documentation for the API, including detailed descriptions of endpoints and response formats. This will help developers integrate your service into their applications more easily.
   - Include a readme file in the project root directory with instructions on how to set up, run, and test the server.

5. Refactoring opportunities:
   - Move the API key configuration to environment variables specific to each AI service. This will make it easier to manage secrets and isolate configurations for each service.
   - Create a separate module (or functions) for handling requests to each AI service, as the current code has multiple duplicated lines of code for making API calls. This refactoring will improve maintainability and reduce the risk of introducing errors when updating or adding new APIs.
   - Consider using a more advanced request library like `axios` for making HTTP requests, as it provides additional features like cancellation support and request interception.
