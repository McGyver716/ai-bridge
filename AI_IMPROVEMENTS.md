## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow the consistency of importing modules by using destructuring assignment for single imports (`const { something } = require('some-module')`). However, since you're only using the default export, it is not necessary in this case.
   - Add type declarations to improve code readability and catch potential errors early. For example: `import express from 'express';`. TypeScript is recommended but not required for this project.
   - Use a linting tool like ESLint with an appropriate airbnb-styleguide or similar style guide configuration to enforce best practices across the entire codebase.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Implement response caching for frequent queries by adding a middleware such as `express-cache`. This can significantly improve the performance of your server if you have high traffic and a large number of repeat requests.
   - Consider using async/await for all API calls instead of fetch, as it allows for easier handling of promises and results in more readable code.
   - Profile your application to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly. Use tools like `node-profiler` or `New Relic` to get insights into performance issues.

3. Security Issues:
   - The current implementation only uses rate limiting, but you might want to consider adding additional security measures such as HTTPS for encrypted connections, CSRF protection, input sanitization, and validation of API keys if possible.
   - Rotate API keys periodically and avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the codebase. You could use a secrets management service like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to store and manage your credentials securely.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints, including examples of requests and responses, error handling, and expected usage scenarios. This will help developers understand how to interact with your server more easily.
   - Write integration guides for each AI service used in the application, outlining any known issues, best practices, and tips for working with those APIs.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into reusable functions or middlewares to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
   - Consider implementing a proper error handling strategy using something like the `express-async-errors` package, which provides a more user-friendly way of handling errors that can be caught and handled in one place instead of having them scattered throughout the application.
   - Use a logging library like Winston or Bunyan for centralized logging, making it easier to track issues and events across your application.
