## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Consider using `async/await` consistently for all your API routes instead of mixing it with `callbacks`. This makes the code easier to read and manage.
   - Use named imports for clarity and better organization:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const { default: cors } = require('cors');
     const helmet = require('helmet');
     // ...
     ````

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Consider using a package like `Brotli` or `Zopfli` for compressing JSON responses to reduce the data size sent over the network.
   - Cache API responses if possible, either in memory (Redis) or on disk (file system), especially for frequently asked questions. This can significantly improve performance by reducing API call latency.

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate input data before using it. Never trust user-supplied data. Use libraries like `joi` or `express-validator` to validate the query and AI parameters in your route handlers.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication.
   - Make sure API keys are never exposed to the client. Store them as environment variables and only read them during runtime.
   - Rate limiting may not be necessary if you have a low traffic app, but it's still a good practice to implement it in case of unexpected surges. Consider using a more sophisticated rate limiter like `express-async-rate-limiter`.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for developers who want to use your API, including examples, error handling information, and supported request/response formats.
   - Use a tool like JSDoc to document your functions and classes, making it easier for other developers to understand your code.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into separate modules or functions. For example, create a utility module that handles API requests and responses.
   - If you plan on adding more AI providers in the future, consider creating an abstraction layer for them to make your code easier to maintain and extend.
   - Use ES6 module syntax instead of CommonJS for better encapsulation and performance.
