## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Modularize your code by creating separate files for different functionalities such as middleware, AI APIs, and route handlers. This will make your code more maintainable and easier to understand.
   - Use async/await consistently for all API calls to ensure better readability and error handling.
   - Consider using ESLint for enforcing coding conventions and catching potential errors early.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Reduce the number of dependencies by minimizing the use of external libraries where possible. In this case, you are using three AI APIs which could potentially slow down your server.
   - Consider using response compression (like gzip) to reduce the size of the responses and speed up data transfer. You can enable it using middleware like `compression`.
   - Use a profiler tool like `New Relic` or `Google Chrome DevTools` to identify any performance bottlenecks in your application.

3. Security Issues:
   - While you are already using `helmet`, consider adding additional security measures such as HTTP-only cookies, Content Security Policy (CSP), and HSTS for better protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
   - Validate user inputs using libraries like `express-validator` to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks.
   - Implement a more secure strategy for storing your API keys, such as encrypting them or storing them in an environment variable manager like `Vault`.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add comprehensive documentation for your API, including details about available endpoints, request and response formats, and any authentication requirements.
   - Document the purpose of each function and describe the expected behavior to make it easier for other developers to understand your code.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Consider using a middleware like `multer` for handling multipart/form-data requests, as this could be useful if you plan on supporting file uploads in the future.
   - You are currently making three API calls to fetch responses from different AI services in the main route handler. This might result in slower response times if one of the APIs takes longer to respond. Refactor this by implementing a queue system or using promises to handle parallel requests more efficiently.
   - Implement error handling for potential issues like network errors and timeout issues that may occur when making API calls.
