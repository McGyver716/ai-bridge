## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use ES6 module syntax for a cleaner import/export structure:
     ```
     export default function app() {
       // ... your code here
     }
     ```
     Then in the main file, you can import it like so:
     ```
     import app from './server';
     ```
   - Use async/await instead of `fetch` and `Promise.allSettled` to simplify the promise handling:
     ```
     const [openAIResponse, grokResponse, claudeResponse] = await Promise.all([
       callOpenAI(query),
       callGrok(query),
       callClaude(query)
     ]);
     ```
   - Instead of hardcoding the AI APIs in your code, consider using environment variables for each endpoint and API key:
     ```
     const OPENAI_API = process.env.OPENAI_API;
     // ... rest of the code
     fetch(`${OPENAI_API}/v1/chat/completions`, { /* ... */ })
     ```

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Consider using a library like `server-timing-middleware` to track API response times for debugging and performance monitoring purposes.
   - If your AI APIs have rate limits, make sure you are handling retries gracefully and waiting the required duration before attempting another request.

3. Security Issues:
   - Rate limiting is a good start, but consider using more robust security measures like HSTS, HPKP, and Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent various types of attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add detailed documentation for each endpoint, including examples, response formats, and any important notes about error handling or rate limits.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Consider separating the AI API calls into separate modules to make your code more modular and easier to maintain and test.
   - If you plan on adding more AI services in the future, create a config file to manage them instead of hardcoding them directly in the code.
   - Instead of logging directly to the console, use a logging library like `winston` for better control over log levels and formatting.
