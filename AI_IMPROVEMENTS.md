## server.js
 This server.js file serves as a bridge to connect to multiple AI APIs based on the provided query and API type. Here are some suggestions for improvement in each category:

1. Code quality and best practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently throughout the codebase for better readability and easier error handling.
   - Use more descriptive variable names, such as using `openAiResponse`, `grokResponse`, etc., instead of just `response`.
   - Consider organizing the AI API calls in separate functions or modules to make the main server file less cluttered and easier to manage.
   - Add comments explaining each section of the code, especially complex parts.
   - Follow the latest best practices for writing Express.js applications, such as using middleware functions instead of app.use().

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Enable Gzip compression to reduce the size of the responses sent from the server. You can use the `compression` middleware for this.
   - Limit the number of tokens returned by each AI API to reduce response sizes and improve performance.
   - Cache responses from the AI APIs where possible to avoid making multiple requests for the same data.
   - Consider using a load balancer if making multiple API calls simultaneously becomes necessary to handle high traffic.

3. Security issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt communication between client and server.
   - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to ensure browsers always use HTTPS.
   - Store sensitive data, such as API keys, in environment variables and never expose them directly in the code or .env file.
   - Verify the authenticity of requests by using signature verification or similar methods.
   - Sanitize user inputs thoroughly to prevent potential attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Add detailed documentation on how to use the API, including examples and error handling scenarios.
   - Include a README file describing the project's purpose, dependencies, setup instructions, and usage guide.

5. Refactoring opportunities:
   - Separate concerns by moving AI API calls into separate modules or functions, as mentioned earlier.
   - Consider using an existing AI chatbot platform like Rasa or Dialogflow for more robust features and easier maintenance.
   - If the application grows significantly, consider splitting it into smaller microservices to improve scalability and maintainability.
