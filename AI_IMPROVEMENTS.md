## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all API calls to make the code more readable and easier to reason about. This also helps in handling errors in a more structured way using try-catch blocks.
   - Consider adding type annotations to function signatures for better TypeScript compatibility and IDE support.
   - Use `eslint` with a suitable configuration to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early. You can find popular ESLint configurations such as Airbnb, Google, and Standard in this repository: https://github.com/folke/eslint-config-prettier

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Consider using a package like `lodash` or native JavaScript methods to reduce the number of times you create arrays with `Promise.allSettled`. For example, you can use `Array.map()` and `Promise.all()` instead.
   - Implement caching strategies for AI API responses if it makes sense for your application's use case. This could help to reduce the number of calls made to external APIs and improve performance.
   - Profile your application using tools like `nyc`, `webpack-bundle-analyzer`, or `chrome devtools` to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

3. Security Issues:
   - Ensure that API keys are never exposed in the client-side code by storing them securely on the server-side, using environment variables or a configuration management system like AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault.
   - Validate user inputs (such as `query` and `ai`) to prevent potential attack vectors, such as SQL injection or Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Use HTTPS for all communication with the server to ensure data integrity and protect against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide clear documentation on how to use your API, including examples of valid query parameters, acceptable AI parameters, and sample requests/responses.
   - Include instructions for setting up the project locally, as well as any dependencies required to run it.
   - Write unit tests for each API endpoint using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to ensure the code works correctly in various scenarios.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract utility functions, such as the AI API calls, into separate modules to improve modularity and maintainability of your codebase.
   - Use a middleware like `morgan` for logging requests and responses to make it easier to debug issues and analyze application performance.
   - Implement error handling strategies to provide more informative error messages to clients in case of server errors or invalid input. For example, you can use custom error classes to create structured error objects with detailed information.
   - Consider using a package like `swagger-jsdoc` to generate API documentation automatically from your code comments. This makes it easier for developers to learn about your API without having to read through the entire codebase.
