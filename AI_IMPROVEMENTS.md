## server.js
 1. **Code Quality and Best Practices:**
   - Consider using ES6 module imports instead of CommonJS for better code organization and compatibility with modern JavaScript projects.
   - Use async/await consistently for handling promises within the API endpoints. This makes your code easier to read and manage.
   - Add type declarations using TypeScript to improve code clarity, catch errors early, and provide better autocompletion in IDEs.
   - Consider implementing logging middleware like Winston or Pino for more structured and customizable logs.

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Use gzip compression to reduce the size of responses sent to clients. This can be achieved using middleware like `compression`.
   - Enable HTTP/2 server push to preload assets that are frequently used, speeding up page loads for clients. You can achieve this with middleware like `http2-push`.
   - Implement caching strategies for your API responses where appropriate, reducing the number of requests made and improving performance. This can be done using middleware like `express-cache` or `helmet-cache-control`.

3. **Security Issues:**
   - Consider adding HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by enforcing HTTPS connections. This can be configured using the `helmet` package.
   - Validate user inputs at the edge with Content Security Policy (CSP). This helps protect against XSS and other injection attacks.
   - Secure your API keys by using environment variables, but make sure to never store sensitive information in version control systems like GitHub. Instead, use secrets management solutions like AWS Secrets Manager or Google Cloud Secrets.
   - Implement Rate Limiting for each API endpoint to protect against brute force attacks and denial-of-service attempts. You can achieve this using `express-rate-limit` or other packages like ` rate-limiter-flexible`.

4. **Documentation Improvements:**
   - Add clear documentation on how to use the API, including examples for each endpoint. This should be accessible through a dedicated page on your project's website or in the project README.md file.
   - Include documentation on available parameters, response formats, and error handling mechanisms.
   - Document any known limitations or issues with the AI services you are using.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities:**
   - Extract common functionality (like fetching AI responses) into separate functions to improve code reusability and reduce duplication.
   - Consider implementing a proper error handling strategy, such as centralizing all errors in a dedicated module that can be used across your application for consistency.
   - Improve the organization of your codebase by grouping related concerns into individual modules or folders. This will make it easier to maintain and extend the project in the future.
