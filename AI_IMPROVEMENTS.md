## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use ES6 import syntax for better readability and consistency:
     ```
     import express from 'express';
     import cors from 'cors';
     import helmet from 'helmet';
     import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
     require('dotenv').config();
     ```
   - Use named functions for clarity and easier debugging:
     ```
     const getHealth = (req, res) => { /* ... */ };
     const aiBridge = (req, res) => { /* ... */ };
     // Rest of the functions
     ```

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Use a production-ready build tool like Webpack or Rollup to bundle your code and minify it for better performance.
   - Enable gzip compression for responses using middleware such as `compression`. This can significantly reduce the size of the response, improving load times.

3. Security Issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt the data in transit and protect against Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
   - Validate user input (e.g., `query` parameter) to prevent potential injection attacks.
   - Consider using a library like `express-session` for managing user sessions securely.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Include a README file at the root of your project that explains how to install, configure, and run your server.
   - Add comments to your code explaining what each function does and any important considerations or edge cases.
   - Consider creating API documentation with tools like Swagger or Postman for developers to easily explore your endpoints.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common code into reusable modules, such as a separate `apiClient` module that handles all API calls.
   - Use async/await throughout your codebase instead of callbacks for better readability and error handling.
   - Consider using a framework like NestJS for building server-side applications to benefit from its built-in features and best practices.
