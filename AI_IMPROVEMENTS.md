## server.js
 1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
   - Modularize your code by creating separate files for each API integration (OpenAI, Grok, Claude) and utility functions like `callAPI`. This will make the code more maintainable and easier to test.
   - Use async/await consistently throughout the codebase for a cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
   - Follow the 12-factor app methodology for Node.js applications, especially focusing on separating configuration from code, starting, stopping, and restarting processes easily, and handling application state (e.g., using a package like `winston` for logging).

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Use a library like `request-promise` or `axios` instead of `fetch` to handle promises natively and avoid callbacks. This can make your code cleaner, more readable, and potentially faster.
   - Consider using a caching mechanism for the AI responses, especially if the same queries are repeated frequently. This could be implemented in memory or persisted to disk/a database depending on the scale of your application.

3. **Security Issues**
   - You already have `helmet` and `rate-limiting` middleware for security purposes. However, consider using HTTPS instead of HTTP for all API requests and responses to ensure data encryption.
   - Use a library like `dotenv-safe` or `dotenv-loader` to safely load environment variables, especially sensitive ones like API keys.

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Document your code with JSDoc comments explaining what each function does, its parameters, return values, and examples if applicable. This will help others understand and use your code more effectively.
   - Include a README file in the project root that describes the purpose of the application, installation instructions, usage examples, available endpoints, and API documentation for third-party services used (OpenAI, Grok, Claude).

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Extract the common structure between the three AI APIs calls (headers, method, body) into a separate function to reduce code duplication.
   - Implement middleware for handling invalid or missing parameters instead of using multiple if/else statements in the main API endpoint. This can make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
   - Consider adding error handling and response validation for all API responses from the third-party services, especially when displaying errors to the user.
