## server.js
 1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
   - Consider using `async/await` consistently for all API requests to improve readability and maintainability.
   - Use ESLint for enforcing consistent coding styles and identifying potential issues. You can configure it with Airbnb's style guide (`.eslintrc.json`) or another popular one like Prettier.
   - Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability and reduce the chances of confusion. For example, `aiResponse` instead of `results[ai]`.
   - Make use of modern JavaScript features, such as arrow functions (`() => {}`) and template literals (`\`backticks\``) where appropriate.

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Since you're using the GPT-4 model which has a higher token limit, consider increasing the `max_tokens` for all API calls to ensure that the server can handle longer responses without breaking the rate limit.
   - Implement response compression to reduce network latency and improve efficiency. Middleware like `compression` can help with this.

3. **Security Issues**
   - The current implementation uses environment variables to store API keys, which is a common practice, but it's also good to remember that those keys are stored in Git repositories when using public ones. Consider using services like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault to securely manage your secrets.
   - Make sure you test the `helmet` middleware configurations thoroughly as they can potentially break some functionality if not set up correctly.
   - Validate and sanitize input data from the client-side before processing on the server-side to prevent potential attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or injection attacks.

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Document all API endpoints, including their purpose, usage, supported query parameters, and return values. This can be done with popular tools such as Swagger or Postman.
   - Provide a README file in the project root that explains how to set up, run, and test the application, along with any dependencies and prerequisites.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Extract common functionality into separate modules/functions to improve code organization and reusability. For example, you can create a function that handles API calls generically for each AI service instead of having three different ones.
   - Consider implementing error handling more robustly, such as creating custom error classes or logging detailed error information when an unexpected error occurs.
