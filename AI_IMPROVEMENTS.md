## server.js
 I've reviewed your `server.js` file and identified several areas where improvements can be made regarding code quality, performance, security, documentation, and refactoring. Here are my suggestions:

1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
   - Use ES6 module syntax to import dependencies instead of CommonJS. This is a modern practice that helps avoid issues with naming conflicts and simplifies the import process.
     ```
     import express from 'express';
     import cors from 'cors';
     // ... other imports
     ```
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all asynchronous functions, making your code easier to read and manage errors. You already started using it in the AI API Integrations section, but you can extend it to other async functions like the main bridge endpoint.

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Add a production environment configuration that enables gzip compression for better response payload sizes. You can use `compression` middleware for this purpose.
     ```
     const compression = require('compression');
     app.use(compression());
     ```
   - Consider using a cache mechanism, such as Redis or Memcached, to store frequently requested data and avoid redundant API calls to OpenAI, Grok, and Claude. You can implement this by modifying the AI API Integrations functions or using a caching middleware.

3. **Security Issues**
   - To further secure your server against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, consider sanitizing user inputs with libraries like `sanitize-html` or `xss-clean`.
   - To protect your API against DDoS attacks, you can implement additional rate limiting strategies, such as setting up per-user limits or using more granular window durations.
     ```
     const limiter = rateLimit({
       max: 100, // keep the same limit
       windowMs: 60 * 15 * 1000, // change to a more granular time period like 15 minutes (900000 milliseconds)
       standardHeaders: true,
       skip: req => req.method === 'OPTIONS', // allow OPTIONS method for CORS preflight checks
     });
     ```
   - Validate and sanitize environment variables before using them to avoid potential security issues from exposing sensitive data or incorrect API key usage. You can use libraries like `dotenv-safe` for this purpose.

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Document the supported API endpoints, their parameters, and response formats in a dedicated README file or documentation website. This will help developers understand how to interact with your server effectively.
   - Include usage examples for each endpoint and explain any edge cases or limitations.
   - Consider providing a Swagger UI (like Swagger, OpenAPI, or Apibase) to facilitate API exploration and testing.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Extract common functions like setting up middlewares into separate modules to improve modularity and maintainability of your codebase.
     ```
     import setupMiddlewares from './middlewares.js';

     const app = express();
     setupMiddlewares(app);
     // ... other code
     ```
   - Consider implementing a request validation library (like `joi` or `ajv`) to validate incoming requests and ensure they adhere to your API's specifications. This can help prevent errors and improve the overall user experience.
   - To handle potential errors more gracefully, you can create an error handling middleware that catches any unhandled errors during request processing and logs them or returns appropriate responses to the client.
