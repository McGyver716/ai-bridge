## server.js
 I've reviewed the code file `server.js` and have identified several areas for improvement in terms of code quality, performance optimizations, security, documentation, and refactoring opportunities. Here are my suggestions:

1. Code quality and best practices:
   - Follow consistent coding styles and formatting rules throughout the codebase (e.g., using Prettier or ESLint) to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.
   - Use descriptive variable and function names, making it easier for developers to understand the code without having to read comments or struggle with abbreviations.
   - Consider adding type annotations (TypeScript) for better type safety and IDE support.
   - Break long functions into smaller, manageable functions, improving readability and maintainability.
   - Use async/await wherever possible instead of callbacks for cleaner code and better error handling.

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Profile the application using tools like `New Relic`, `Google Chrome DevTools`, or `Node.js built-in profiler` to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
   - Consider caching responses from AI APIs (e.g., Redis) if query results can be reused for a certain period, as repeated calls to the AI APIs can consume significant resources.
   - Implement pagination or limit the number of responses returned by each API call to reduce the data transferred between your application and the AI APIs.

3. Security issues:
   - Ensure that you store sensitive keys (OpenAI API Key, Grok API Key, Claude API Key) securely (e.g., using environment variables or secure secrets management solutions like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager).
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs (query and ai parameters) to protect against potential injection attacks.
   - Implement proper error handling for unexpected conditions and ensure that sensitive data is not accidentally leaked in error responses.
   - Perform regular security audits using tools like OWASP ZAP or Snyk to identify vulnerabilities and improve the overall security of your application.

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Add comprehensive documentation for your API, including endpoints, request/response examples, error handling, and supported parameters (e.g., Swagger, Postman).
   - Include code comments describing what each function does and how it integrates with the overall application flow.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to set up, run, test, and deploy the application in your README file.

5. Refactoring opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality from the AI API integration functions (e.g., creating a generic `callAIAPI` function with a configurable API key) for better code reuse and maintainability.
   - Centralize error handling by creating an ErrorHandler middleware that can be used across the application to improve consistency in error responses.
   - Consider using a request/response validation library (e.g., JSON Schema, Joi) to validate incoming requests against a schema, ensuring that users provide the correct data format and structure.
   - Use a dependency management tool like Lerna or Yarn Workspaces if you have multiple microservices or packages to manage more efficiently.
