## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `const` for all variables to ensure they are not accidentally reassigned.
   - Consider using a linter such as ESLint to enforce consistent coding style across the project.
   - Add type annotations to functions and variables for better code clarity and type safety.
   - Use async/await wherever possible instead of `Promise.allSettled`.
   - Consider splitting large functions into smaller, more manageable ones to improve readability and maintainability.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache API responses when possible. This can significantly reduce the number of requests made to each AI service.
   - Use gzip compression for sending responses from the server to minimize the amount of data sent over the network.
   - Consider using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for serving static assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images.

3. Security Issues:
   - Store API keys securely by using environment variables or encryption techniques. Never hard-code API keys directly into your code.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt data in transit between the client and server.
   - Validate user inputs to prevent potential attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add detailed comments and explanations throughout the codebase to help future maintainers understand the project's purpose, design decisions, and implementation details.
   - Write a README file that explains how to install, run, test, and use the application.
   - Document any known issues or limitations in the codebase.
   - Include instructions on how to report bugs or request new features.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Consider using a middleware library such as Express-Mongoose to handle database interactions, which can simplify and improve the organization of your server-side code.
   - Create utility functions for common tasks like handling errors, validating user inputs, or formatting responses. This will make the code more reusable and easier to maintain.
   - Use a separate file or module for each API endpoint to keep the code organized and easy to understand.
