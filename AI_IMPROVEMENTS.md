## server.js
 I've analyzed your server.js file, and here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. **Code quality and best practices**:
   - Follow a consistent coding style using either ESLint or Prettier for formatting, and airbnb or standard as the style guide.
   - Add type annotations to variables and function parameters to make your code more robust and easier to understand.
   - Use async/await instead of .then/.catch for promises, making error handling cleaner and easier to read.
   - Consider using a dependency management tool like Lerna or Yarn Workspaces if you have multiple related projects within the same repository.

2. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Use response compression (gzip) by adding `app.use(compression())`. This reduces the size of responses and speeds up transfer times.
   - Cache static assets with a package like `express-static-cache`. This can significantly reduce server load for frequently accessed files.
   - Consider using a more efficient AI API based on your specific use case to avoid unnecessary latency due to slower APIs.

3. **Security issues**:
   - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) by setting the `Strict-Transport-Security` header in your helmet middleware configuration. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by forcing browsers to use secure connections.
   - Use HTTP-only cookies with the 'Secure' flag to help protect against XSS attacks. You can achieve this using the `cookie-parser` library along with helmet.
   - Ensure you are storing API keys securely, ideally using environment variables and never hardcoding them in your code or version control system.

4. **Documentation improvements**:
   - Provide documentation on how to set up and use the server correctly. This can be done via README.md or by creating a dedicated documentation website.
   - Include examples for making API requests, including cURL examples and sample code snippets in various programming languages.
   - Explain the purpose and expected usage of each function in your codebase.

5. **Refactoring opportunities**:
   - Consider moving AI API calls into separate modules or services to make your code more modular and easier to test and maintain.
   - Split health check and main bridge endpoints into separate files, reducing the size of your server.js file and improving organization.
   - Implement request validation using a library like `express-validator` to ensure that incoming requests meet certain criteria. This can help prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
