## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Consider using ESLint for enforcing a consistent coding style and catching potential errors before running the code. You can install it by running `npm install eslint --save-dev` and then configure it based on your preferred ruleset.
   - Use descriptive variable names to make the code more readable. For example, instead of `app`, you could use `server`.
   - In the main bridge endpoint, consider using try-catch blocks inside the Promise.allSettled loop to handle any individual API call errors appropriately.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - To improve performance, consider caching API responses if appropriate for your use case. This can be done by storing responses in a database or in memory.
   - Implement pagination or limit the number of API calls per request to prevent overloading your servers and the external APIs.

3. Security Issues:
   - Ensure that you rotate your API keys periodically to avoid unauthorized access if one of your keys is compromised.
   - Sanitize user input on all endpoints, especially in the query parameter, to protect against potential attacks such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Consider using a library like `express-async-errors` for handling errors more effectively and preventing leaking of sensitive information.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add comments to the code to explain what each section does, especially in complex sections like the main bridge endpoint.
   - Write comprehensive README.md file that explains how to install, run, and use the server.js, as well as any configuration options available.
   - Provide examples of valid input for each API and include error responses with their meanings.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract functions for making API calls into separate modules to make the server.js more modular and easier to maintain.
   - Consider using async/await instead of Promise.allSettled in the main bridge endpoint to simplify the code and improve readability.
   - Separate the security middleware (helmet, cors) and rate limiting into their own sections for better organization.
