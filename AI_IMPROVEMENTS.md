## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow consistent coding styles. You can use tools like ESLint and Prettier to enforce a standard across your codebase.
   - Use descriptive variable names for better readability. For example, `aiCalls` could be renamed to something more descriptive like `apiPromises`.
   - Consider using async/await instead of Promise.allSettled as it provides cleaner syntax and easier error handling.
   - Add type declarations (TypeScript) for better type safety and improved development experience.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Use gzip compression to reduce the size of responses sent from your server. You can use middleware like `compression` for this.
   - Cache API responses if they are not expected to change frequently. This can be done using a library like Redis or Memcached.
   - Implement pagination instead of fetching all responses at once, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

3. Security Issues:
   - Sanitize user input (query) to prevent potential attacks like SQL injection and XSS attacks. You can use libraries like `express-sanitizer` for this.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt communication between client and server.
   - Validate environment variables (API keys) on the server side to ensure they are present and valid before using them.
   - Implement content security policy (CSP) to help protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write clear, concise documentation for your API endpoints and AI integrations. This should include example requests and responses, and any required or optional parameters.
   - Document any known limitations or issues with the API, as well as best practices for using it effectively.
   - Provide a README file with installation instructions, usage examples, and information about how to contribute to your project.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into reusable functions or modules to reduce code duplication. For example, create a function for making API calls that accepts an API object (API key, URL, etc.) as an argument.
   - Consider using a framework like NestJS for better structure and organization of your server-side application.
   - Use middleware to handle common tasks such as logging, error handling, and authentication/authorization. This can help keep your routes cleaner and more maintainable.
