## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Modularize your codebase for better organization and maintainability. Separate the AI API integrations into individual modules (e.g., openAI.js, grok.js, claude.js). This will improve readability and reduce duplicated code.
   - Use consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase. For example, variable names should be camelCase, function names should be PascalCase, and constants should be ALL_CAPS.
   - Add comments to explain complex sections of your code or any non-standard practices you've used. This will help future developers better understand your implementation.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache the results from the AI APIs if possible, as they can be slow and expensive. Implement caching at the application level or consider using a distributed cache like Redis for better performance.
   - Use async/await with `fetch` to make your code more readable and easier to manage promises.
   - Monitor your server's performance using tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Prometheus to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

3. Security Issues:
   - Store sensitive API keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them directly into the codebase. This will prevent leaking your secrets if someone gains access to your source code.
   - Validate and sanitize user input before passing it to any external APIs to protect against injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.
   - Implement HTTPS for all requests, as HTTP can be insecure and may allow attackers to intercept sensitive data.
   - Regularly update your dependencies and follow best practices for dependency management to minimize the risk of security breaches.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide comprehensive documentation on how to use your API, including examples of valid requests and responses, error handling, and any required authentication steps. This will make it easier for developers to integrate with your service.
   - Write clear and concise comments throughout the codebase to help future developers understand your implementation.
   - Document any known limitations or caveats associated with your API, as well as any plans for future improvements or features.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Consider using a framework like NestJS or Fastify for better organization and scalability of your server application. These frameworks provide built-in support for middleware, routing, and dependency injection, which can help simplify your codebase and make it easier to maintain.
   - Use typed variables and functions wherever possible to catch errors early in the development process. TypeScript is a popular choice for this, but other static typing languages (e.g., Rust, Go) could also be considered.
   - Refactor any repeated logic into reusable functions or modules to improve code readability and maintainability. This will also help reduce the likelihood of bugs being introduced through copy-paste errors.
   - Implement unit tests for your server and API endpoints to ensure they work as expected and catch any regressions during future updates.
