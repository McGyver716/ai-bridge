## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow consistent coding styles. Consider using a linter like ESLint to enforce a style guide such as Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide or the Standard.
   - Use descriptive variable names for better readability and maintainability of the code.
   - Add type declarations using TypeScript, if possible, for type safety and improved IDE support.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Consider using a tool like `reqres-mock` to handle API requests during development and testing, reducing the load on actual APIs.
   - Cache API responses if appropriate and safe (e.g., using Redis or another caching solution).
   - Profile the application using tools such as `YARP` or `NYC` to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate input data thoroughly before passing it to APIs, and sanitize output data before sending it back to clients.
   - Use environment variables with `dotenv-safe` instead of directly exposing API keys in the code.
   - Regularly review and update dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or Dependabot.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add comprehensive documentation about the purpose, usage, and endpoints of the application. This can be generated using a tool like JSDoc.
   - Include information on how to install and run the server, as well as any necessary dependencies.
   - Write tests for each endpoint to ensure proper functionality and document them accordingly.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functions or utilities into separate modules to improve code organization and reduce duplication.
   - Use async/await instead of `Promise.allSettled` and handle rejections individually for better error handling.
   - Split the server logic across multiple files or modules if the current file becomes too large and complex.
