## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all your API calls to make the code more readable and easier to reason about.
   - Use named functions for your API call functions (e.g., `callOpenAIFunction`, `callGrokFunction`, etc.) for better modularity and reusability.
   - Consider using ESLint with a suitable config like Airbnb or Standard to enforce consistent coding style across the codebase.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Use response compression (gzip) to reduce the size of responses sent over the network, improving load times and reducing bandwidth usage. You can use middleware such as `compression` for this purpose.
   - Consider implementing request caching for frequently accessed AI APIs to reduce API call latency.
   - If your server handles a high volume of requests, consider using a connection pool or a proxy like Haproxy to distribute the load more evenly and improve performance.

3. Security Issues:
   - It's recommended to use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication over the network. You can achieve this by purchasing an SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) or using Let's Encrypt for free certificates.
   - Token-based authentication is not being used in your current setup, and it's crucial for securing API access. Implement JWT-based authentication to authenticate users before allowing them to make requests to your server.
   - Validate user inputs (e.g., `query`, `ai`, `format`) on the client side as well to help prevent malicious attacks.
   - Sanitize and validate responses from third-party APIs before using them in your application.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide a clear README file that describes how to install, configure, and use the server, including any dependencies and environment variables.
   - Add comments explaining what each function does, its input parameters, and return values, making it easier for other developers to understand the codebase.
   - Document any known limitations or caveats about the server's functionality.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Consider moving AI API integration functions into a separate module (e.g., `ai-integration.js`) to improve modularity and separation of concerns in your application. This would also make it easier to switch between different AI providers if necessary.
   - You can use a logging library like Winston for centralized logging, which can help with debugging and monitoring the server's performance.
   - Implement logging middleware to capture essential information about incoming requests and responses, which can aid in troubleshooting issues and improving overall system performance.
