## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently throughout the codebase for better readability and error handling. For example, in the `app.get('/ai-bridge')` function, you can replace the `Promise.allSettled()` with an `async` function and use `try/catch` blocks for each API call.
   - Use TypeScript to add static types to your variables and functions, which will make the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
   - Consider using ESLint for enforcing a consistent coding style across your team. You can configure it with Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide (airbnb) or Google's JavaScript Style Guide (google).

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache API responses when possible to reduce the number of calls made to third-party services. Implement a cache layer using Redis or another in-memory data structure.
   - Use request batching to send multiple requests in one go, which can help improve performance if your application makes frequent and short API calls.
   - Profile your application using tools like Google Chrome DevTools or New Relic to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

3. Security Issues:
   - Store sensitive environment variables like API keys securely by using a secrets manager such as AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Hashicorp's Vault.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt communication between the client and server. You can configure SSL/TLS certificates with services like Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare.
   - Validate user inputs to prevent any potential injection attacks on your API. Sanitize inputs before passing them to third-party APIs.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide clear and concise documentation for the API endpoints, including example requests and responses, supported query parameters, and error handling scenarios. You can use tools like Swagger or Postman to generate API documentation automatically from your code.
   - Document any known issues, workarounds, and best practices related to each third-party API integration. This will help other developers who may be using your code in the future.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Move common middleware (CORS, Helmet, Rate Limiting) into a separate function that can be easily imported and used across all routes.
   - Use modules to structure your codebase more effectively and improve readability. For example, you could create separate modules for the AI API integrations, error handling, and health check endpoints.
   - Implement logging using libraries like Winston or Bunyan to monitor requests, errors, and other important events in your application. This can help with debugging and understanding the behavior of your codebase.
   - Consider using a service like PM2 to manage your Node.js application and handle features such as clustering for better performance and uptime.
