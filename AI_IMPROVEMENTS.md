## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Consider using `async/await` consistently for all your fetch calls to make your code more readable and easier to manage. This will also help in handling errors more gracefully.
   - Use `const` for variables that are not re-assigned, such as `PORT`, to improve readability.
   - Consider using a linter like ESLint to enforce coding style and rules across your project. You can use Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide (`.airbnb`) as a base configuration.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Use compression middleware like `compression` to reduce the size of responses, especially for larger JSON objects. This can help improve network performance.
   - Enable gzip compression on your server by adding the following line after `app.use(express.json())`: `app.enable('trust proxy')`. This will allow Express to trust X-Forwarded-For headers from proxies, enabling compression for requests behind proxies.
   - Consider caching responses using a library like Redis or Memcached if your application handles many repeat queries.

3. Security Issues:
   - The code already uses Helmet and rate limiting for security, which is good. However, it's important to keep up with updates for these dependencies to ensure you're protected against new vulnerabilities.
   - It would be wise to use a library like `express-session` for handling user sessions if your application needs to remember users between requests. This can help prevent session fixation attacks.
   - Ensure sensitive data (like API keys) are never hardcoded into the client-side code or checked into version control systems. Instead, use environment variables, .env files, and secure methods for managing secrets.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Include a README file that explains what the project does, how to install it, and how to run it. This can help others understand your project more quickly.
   - Add comments to your code to explain complex parts or why certain decisions were made. This will make it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand the codebase.
   - Consider adding documentation for the API endpoints, including examples of valid requests and responses, and any necessary authentication requirements.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - The `callOpenAI`, `callGrok`, and `callClaude` functions are quite similar in structure. You could create a base function that accepts an API object (with parameters like the API URL, headers, and body) to reduce code duplication and make changes easier if one of the APIs is updated.
   - Consider moving the AI API integration code into a separate module and importing it here to keep your server file more focused on handling requests and responses. This can also help with code organization and reusability.
   - You could add middleware to handle errors consistently throughout your application, making it easier to debug and maintain. For example, you could create a custom error handling middleware that logs errors and sends a custom response to the client.
