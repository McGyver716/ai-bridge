## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions. For example, use `camelCase` instead of a mix of camelCase and underscore_case.
   - Add comments to explain the purpose of complex or critical sections of code. This helps other developers understand your implementation.
   - Consider using ESLint with Airbnb style guide or another popular style guide to enforce consistent coding practices across your project.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Use async/await only when necessary, as it creates additional overhead. For simple cases where a callback would suffice, consider using it instead.
   - Cache API responses if the data is expected to change infrequently or use caching libraries like Redis for better performance.
   - Consider using gzip compression for JSON responses to reduce the size of data sent over the network. This can be done easily with middleware like `compression`.

3. Security Issues:
   - The OpenAI API key is exposed in the code, which could lead to unauthorized access if your repository is not private. Store sensitive information like API keys securely using environment variables or secrets management services like AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault.
   - Ensure that the `dotenv` package is installed and configured correctly so that the environment variables are loaded at runtime.
   - Validate user inputs to prevent possible injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all requests to ensure data integrity and secure communication.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add a README file that includes the project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and any necessary dependencies.
   - Document any custom functions or middleware you create, explaining their purpose and usage.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract helper functions to make the code more modular and easier to maintain. For example, separate the AI API calls into individual functions.
   - Use type annotations for better code readability and type safety.
   - Consider using Promises instead of callbacks for a cleaner, more readable asynchronous code structure.
   - Consider adding error handling and validation checks in the main bridge endpoint to handle malformed requests gracefully.
   - Refactor the health check route to use an express middleware like `express-healthcheck` for easier integration with monitoring tools.
   - Consider using a package like `winston` or `pino` for structured logging, making it easier to analyze log files and troubleshoot issues.
