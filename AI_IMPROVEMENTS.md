## server.js
 I've analyzed your server.js file and found several areas for improvement in terms of code quality, performance optimizations, security issues, documentation, and refactoring opportunities:

1. Code quality and best practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently within the route handler to improve readability. For example, replace the `Promise.allSettled` usage with async/await.
   - Add type declarations for variables and functions using TypeScript if possible.
   - Consider separating configuration from code by using a separate file (e.g., index.ts or config.ts) to manage constants like API keys, model versions, etc.
   - Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent coding style across the project.

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Caching API responses based on query parameters can help improve performance for repeat requests.
   - Consider using a library like Redis or Memcached for caching.
   - Profiling your code with tools like `nyc` and `coverage-badge` can help identify bottlenecks and areas to optimize further.

3. Security issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP by configuring an SSL certificate to secure data transmitted between the client and server.
   - Implement input validation to protect against potential attacks like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.
   - Consider using a library like `joi` for input validation.

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Improve code comments to explain complex parts of the code and provide context for new developers.
   - Create an API documentation page with examples, error handling information, and usage guidelines.
   - Add README.md file explaining project structure, dependencies, and installation instructions.

5. Refactoring opportunities:
   - Extract common functions (e.g., the AI API call function) to a separate module for better organization and reusability.
   - Implement middleware for error handling to centralize and manage errors more effectively.
   - Consider using a microservices architecture for more complex applications, which can help improve scalability and maintainability.
