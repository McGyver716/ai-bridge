## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow JavaScript Standard Style (JSXS) for consistent code formatting across the project. You can use ESLint with JSXS to enforce this.
   - Use descriptive variable names and function names for better readability.
   - Consider using async/await consistently for promise handling, as it makes the code more readable and easier to manage.
   - Separate configuration of middlewares into a separate file (e.g., `middleware.js`) to keep the server entry point cleaner.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache responses from AI APIs when possible to reduce the number of requests and improve performance. Implement caching in memory or using a library like Redis for better scalability.
   - Use response compression (gzip) to decrease the size of responses and improve transfer speeds. Enable gzip by adding `app.enable('compression')` and middleware `app.use(compression())`.
   - Lazy load or remove unused dependencies to minimize server start time and reduce bundle size.

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate input data (queries, headers) to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Use libraries like `express-validator` for input validation.
   - Rate limiting should be applied to individual endpoints instead of globally to ensure fair usage without affecting other APIs. You can use a library like `express-rate-limit` or implement your own rate limiter based on the specific needs of each endpoint.
   - Ensure that API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, GROK_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY) are properly stored and not hardcoded in the code. Consider using environment variables in a secure manner or implementing secret management solutions like AWS Secrets Manager.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide clear and concise API documentation with examples, error messages, and supported query parameters. This helps developers understand how to properly interact with your API.
   - Include details about API versioning, breaking changes between versions, and upgrade paths for users.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into reusable functions or modules, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
   - Consider using a library like `axios` instead of native Fetch API for easier handling of promises and more configuration options.
   - Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure that the application works as expected under various conditions. This helps catch bugs early and reduces the chances of regressions when making changes to the codebase.
