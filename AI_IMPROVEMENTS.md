## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow consistent coding style guidelines (e.g., Airbnb, Google) to ensure code readability and maintainability.
   - Add comments and documentation for complex functions and modules.
   - Consider using type checking with TypeScript to catch potential errors early in the development process.
   - Use ES6 import syntax instead of `require` for better modularity and tree-shaking during bundling.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Measure performance bottlenecks using tools like New Relic or Google Chrome's DevTools to optimize your server efficiently.
   - Consider caching responses from AI APIs, especially if they take a long time to process or are expensive to call.
   - Limit the number of AI API calls per request by adding pagination or rate limiting on the client-side instead of relying solely on `express-rate-limit`.

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate user inputs (query, ai, format) on the server-side to prevent potential injection attacks.
   - Use HTTPS for all endpoints and handle certificate errors properly.
   - Implement proper error handling and logging for security vulnerabilities.
   - Rotate API keys securely and periodically, especially for third-party services like OpenAI, Grok, and Claude.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write clear and concise documentation for all endpoints, including example requests/responses and error messages.
   - Include a README file that describes the project's purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and any important notes or caveats.
   - Consider using Swagger or another API documentation tool to automatically generate docs from your server code.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Split the codebase into smaller modules or services for better modularity and scalability.
   - Extract helper functions for common tasks, such as making API calls or handling responses, to make the main file less cluttered.
   - Consider using a framework like Fastify or Hapi for easier management of routes, middleware, and other server aspects.
   - Use middleware to handle common tasks like logging, CORS, and rate limiting instead of adding them to each route separately.
   - Implement error handling consistently across the entire codebase, including custom error classes and centralized error handling functions.
