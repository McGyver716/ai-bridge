## server.js
 I've analyzed your `server.js` file and identified several areas for improvement based on the focus points you provided. Here are my suggestions:

1. Code quality and best practices:
   - Add comments to functions and sections of code that aren't self-explanatory, especially when dealing with external APIs. This will make your code more readable and maintainable for future developers.
   - Follow a consistent coding style. Use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (") consistently for string literals and be consistent with spacing and line breaks.
   - Consider using ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style across the project, as well as detect potential errors and code smells.

2. Performance optimizations:
   - Reduce the maximum number of tokens for each AI API call if possible. This will reduce the response size and improve performance.
   - Cache responses from the AI APIs where appropriate to avoid making unnecessary requests. However, be aware of potential staleness issues and the need for proper cache invalidation mechanisms.
   - Consider using a library like `node-cache` or `memjs` for simple caching solutions. For more complex scenarios, you may want to consider using Redis or other distributed caching systems.

3. Security issues:
   - Ensure that the API keys for external services are properly secured. Do not store them in the codebase, especially in version control systems. Instead, use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Hashicorp Vault.
   - Consider adding JWT authentication to protect sensitive endpoints and prevent unauthorized access.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all requests to ensure data is encrypted in transit.

4. Documentation improvements:
   - Add detailed documentation for the API, including a README file with information about how to install, run, and test the project locally. Include examples for each endpoint, especially the main `/ai-bridge` endpoint.
   - Write unit tests for all functions and endpoints to ensure they behave as expected and help maintain the codebase over time.
   - Document any known limitations or edge cases of the AI APIs used in the project.

5. Refactoring opportunities:
   - Consider using async/await instead of Promises directly when working with Promise-based APIs like fetch(). This makes your code more readable and easier to follow.
   - Use destructuring assignments where appropriate to make your code cleaner and more concise.
   - Instead of using `console.log()` for debugging, consider adding custom error classes and logging functions to provide a consistent output format and centralized logging.
