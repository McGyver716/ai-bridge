## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide to maintain consistent coding style across the project. You can install it as a linter using `npm install eslint babel-eslint airbnb`. Adding these lines to your `.eslintrc.js` file will configure ESLint accordingly:
     ```
     {
       "extends": ["airbnb"],
       "rules": {
         "indent": ["error", 2],
         "linebreak-style": ["error", "unix"],
         "quotes": ["error", "double"],
         "semi": ["error", "always"]
       }
     }
     ```
   - Use `async/await` only when working with promises. In this case, it's already being used correctly.
   - Consider using a logging library like Winston for more structured and flexible logging functionality.
   - You can use Prettier along with ESLint for auto-formatting your codebase. Install it using `npm install prettier --save` and add the following to your scripts section in `package.json`:
     ```
     "scripts": {
       ...
       "format": "prettier --write .",
       ...
     }
     ```

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Consider using a caching mechanism for the AI API responses to reduce unnecessary requests and improve response times. You can implement this at the application level or use a dedicated service like Redis.
   - Profile your application using tools such as Node.js built-in profiler (`node --inspect-brk server.js`) or third-party libraries like New Relic to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
   - Minimize the use of `await` inside loops, as it can block the event loop and cause performance issues.

3. Security Issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt communication between your server and clients. You can configure this by obtaining an SSL certificate and modifying your Express app configuration accordingly.
   - Validate user inputs (query parameters, headers, etc.) to prevent potential attacks such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Consider using libraries like Helmet for additional security features.
   - Rotate API keys periodically and store them in a secure environment like AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault. Avoid committing sensitive data, including API keys, to version control systems.
   - Implement request rate limiting at the application level as well as using `express-rate-limit` for an additional layer of protection against DDoS attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write clear and concise comments throughout your codebase to make it easier for others (and future you) to understand what's happening in each part of the application.
   - Create a README file that outlines project requirements, dependencies, setup instructions, and any other important information.
   - Include usage examples in API documentation, such as sample requests and expected responses, to make it easier for developers to interact with your server.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into separate functions or modules to improve code organization and reduce redundancy. For example, create a generic AI API call function that accepts the model name as an argument instead of having three separate functions for each AI service.
   - Implement error handling strategies, such as centralized error logging, exception filtering, and custom error classes, to make your code more robust and easier to maintain.
   - Consider using a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup to optimize your application's build process, including minification, tree shaking, and source mapping.
