## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions. For example, variable names should be camelCase (e.g., `limiter`, `app`) while function names should be PascalCase (e.g., `callOpenAI`, `callGrok`).
   - Consider using modules export/import syntax instead of global assignments (e.g., import express, cors, helmet, rateLimit, dotenv from '...').
   - Document your code with JSDoc comments for better understanding and maintainability.
   - Use async-await syntax consistently for handling promises throughout the codebase.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large inputs or multiple API calls.
   - Consider using a library like `request` or `axios` instead of `fetch` for better performance and flexibility.
   - If response data is not required, set response headers such as Cache-Control or Expires to improve caching efficiency.
   - Limit the number of API calls made by implementing a mechanism to store previous responses in memory (e.g., cache).

3. Security Issues:
   - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce HTTPS connections for improved security. Add `helmet.hsts()` middleware after `app.use(helmet())`.
   - Use Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by adding `helmet.contentSecurityPolicy()` middleware with appropriate policy settings.
   - Validate user inputs thoroughly and sanitize them to protect against injection attacks (SQL, XSS).
   - Implement rate limiting for individual clients or endpoints to protect against brute-force attacks and Denial of Service (DoS).

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide API documentation for each endpoint in an easily accessible location, such as a dedicated website or GitHub repository.
   - Include examples of valid requests and responses, as well as error messages and status codes.
   - Consider using Swagger or OpenAPI for generating and documenting the API.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract helper functions to separate concerns (e.g., create a helper function for making AI API calls).
   - Move the AI API keys into environment variables specific to each service (OPENAI_API_KEY, GROK_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY) instead of having them all in one file.
   - Create a separate configuration module or file for managing settings such as rate limits, security middleware, and API keys.
   - Consider using a framework like NestJS or Express-typed for better type safety, better organization, and improved maintainability.
