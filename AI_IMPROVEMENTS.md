## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Modularize your code by creating separate files for each API integration (OpenAI, Grok, Claude) to improve maintainability and readability. This also reduces the risk of conflicts between different integrations.
   - Use ES6 import syntax instead of CommonJS require() for better modularity and tree shaking during bundling.
   - Implement ESLint with a suitable configuration (e.g., Airbnb or Standard) to enforce a consistent coding style and catch potential errors.
   - Use descriptive variable names and function parameters.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Profile the application using tools like Chrome DevTools or Node.js built-in profiler to identify bottlenecks.
   - Lazy load resources if possible to reduce initial load time.
   - Implement caching strategies, especially for API responses as they can be costly and have a high rate of duplication.
   - Optimize the number of messages sent to AI APIs to minimize requests and improve performance.

3. Security Issues:
   - Store sensitive data (APIs keys) in environment variables at runtime, but never commit them to version control systems.
   - Validate input from users or external services thoroughly to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to protect against XSS attacks.
   - Implement HTTPS for secure communication between client and server.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write thorough comments explaining the purpose of functions, variables, and modules.
   - Include documentation on how to use your API, including example queries, acceptable values for parameters, and response formats.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to set up the environment and run the server locally.
   - Add an README.md file at the root of the project with all the necessary information mentioned above.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common logic into reusable functions or modules for better maintainability.
   - Implement middleware to handle errors and logging for easier debugging and monitoring.
   - Use async/await instead of promises for cleaner code and easier error handling.
   - Consider using a framework like NestJS or Express Generator for faster development, built-in features, and better organization.
