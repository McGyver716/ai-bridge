## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all HTTP requests instead of mixing with `.then()` for better readability and error handling.
   - Add comments to functions explaining their purpose, especially for external APIs like OpenAI, Grok, and Claude to improve maintainability.
   - Consider using a linter like ESLint to enforce coding standards across your project.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache API responses if appropriate for each AI service to reduce server load and latency.
   - Implement request batching or parallelism to make multiple API calls more efficient, especially when handling multiple queries simultaneously.
   - Monitor the application using a tool like New Relic or AppDynamics to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.

3. Security Issues:
   - The current implementation only uses rate limiting at the server level. To enhance security, consider adding additional layers of defense such as JWT authentication for sensitive API calls and input validation for user queries.
   - Ensure that all environment variables (API keys) are securely stored by using a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault instead of storing them in plain text files or Git repositories.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Provide clear documentation on how to use the API, including examples and potential edge cases. This could be done by updating the comment for the `/ai-bridge` endpoint or by creating a separate file for API documentation.
   - Include information about how to configure and deploy the application in a README file.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality between AI APIs into reusable functions to improve code maintainability and reduce duplication.
   - Consider using a microservice architecture for better scalability, especially as the number of API calls and services grow. Each service can then be optimized independently based on its specific requirements.
   - Use environment variables to manage configuration settings, like the port number, instead of hardcoding them within the codebase.
