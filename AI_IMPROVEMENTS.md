## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use ES modules instead of CommonJS for better interoperability and smaller bundle sizes. You can export the `app` object as default and import it as such.
   - Consider using a linting tool like ESLint to enforce a coding style across your project. This can help maintain consistency and make the code easier to read.
   - Use descriptive variable names and follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Measure and profile the application using tools like `New Relic`, `AppDynamics`, or `Google Chrome DevTools` to identify any bottlenecks.
   - Consider implementing caching strategies for API responses, especially when using AI services that might take a significant amount of time to respond.
   - Lazy load any resources that aren't immediately necessary to improve initial load times.

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate user inputs (`query`, `ai`, and `format`) on the server-side to prevent potential attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Injection Attacks.
   - Use HTTPS for secure communication between clients and the server, especially when handling sensitive data like API keys.
   - Consider using a package like `hapi` or `koa` that offers more robust security features compared to express.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write comprehensive documentation for your API, including example requests, response formats, and any necessary authentication requirements.
   - Include details on how to obtain and use the various API keys required for AI integrations.
   - Provide guidelines on handling errors and error codes returned by the API.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into reusable modules or functions, such as the fetching logic for different AI APIs. This can help reduce code duplication and make maintenance easier.
   - Consider using a microservices architecture to decouple the various components of your application for better scalability and maintainability.
   - Use dependency injection to make your code more modular, testable, and easier to understand.
