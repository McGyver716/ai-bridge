## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `const` for all variables to avoid unintended global pollution.
   - Consider using a linter like ESLint to enforce consistent coding style across the project.
   - Use arrow functions where possible for conciseness (e.g., `app.get('/health', (req, res) => { ... })`).

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Measure and analyze the performance of API calls to identify potential bottlenecks. Consider using tools like New Relic or Apache Benchmark for this.
   - Implement caching strategies to improve response times. This can be done at the server level or within the AI APIs themselves, if supported.
   - Limit the number of messages sent to each AI API per request (max_tokens) to reduce the amount of data transferred and improve performance.

3. Security Issues:
   - Token management is crucial when making external API calls. Store tokens in environment variables instead of hardcoding them directly into your code. Consider using a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault for secure token storage.
   - Implement input validation to ensure that all incoming requests are well-formed and adhere to the expected format (e.g., use `req.query` only when the request is a GET, and use `req.body` for POST requests).

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add comprehensive API documentation that includes endpoints, request/response formats, and examples. This can be done using tools like Swagger or JSDoc.
   - Include a README file in the project root directory with an overview of the application, installation instructions, and usage examples.
   - Document any dependencies, their versions, and any known compatibility issues.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Consider separating the AI APIs into separate modules to make the code more modular and easier to maintain.
   - Extract common functionality (e.g., error handling) into reusable functions or middleware.
   - Implement asynchronous processing using Node.js's built-in `async`/`await` syntax for better readability and flow control when dealing with concurrent tasks.
   - Consider implementing a request throttling strategy to ensure that the server does not become overwhelmed by too many requests, especially during peak usage times.
