## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use ESLint for enforcing a consistent coding style, catching potential errors, and improving readability. Install it by running `npm install eslint --save-dev`. Configure it with Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide (`.eslintrc.json`).
   - Add comments to functions and complex sections of the code to improve understanding for future developers.
   - Consider using a modular approach, breaking down the file into smaller modules or files based on functionality. This will make the code easier to maintain and understand.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Limit the number of API calls per response by setting an appropriate max_tokens for each AI service call. Currently, all three services have a maximum token limit of 500. You might want to experiment with lower values based on your use case and performance needs.
   - Caching API responses could also help improve performance. Implement caching strategies like Redis or Memcached.

3. Security Issues:
   - The current implementation uses hardcoded API keys for each service, which is not secure. Consider using environment variables with a secrets management solution (like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault) to manage and protect your API keys.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all requests. This can be done by setting the protocol to 'https' in the fetch method.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add clear documentation on how to use the server, including examples of valid queries, supported AI services, and configuration options. You can document your API using tools like Swagger or Postman.
   - Document any custom modules, functions, or libraries used in the project, explaining their purpose and usage.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - The 'call*' functions for each AI service are quite similar. Consider creating a more generic function to make API calls and then pass in the necessary configurations (like URL, API key, model, etc.) as parameters. This will simplify the code and reduce redundancy.
   - Move the rate limiting middleware to the top of the list, before other middlewares that might trigger additional requests. This ensures rate limits are applied early in the request-response cycle.
   - If there's a possibility of having multiple instances of the server running simultaneously, consider implementing a mechanism to manage concurrent connections and prevent resource exhaustion.
