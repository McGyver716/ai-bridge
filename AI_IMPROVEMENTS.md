## server.js
 1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**:
   - Consider using `async/await` consistently for all your API routes instead of mixing it with the traditional callback style in the `/ai-bridge` endpoint. This will make your code easier to read and manage.
   - Use `camelCase` for variable names throughout the code. Currently, some variables use `snake_case`.
   - Add type declarations (TypeScript) for better type safety, especially when dealing with third-party APIs. It also helps IDEs provide better autocompletion and error checking.

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement response caching for the AI API calls when the input query hasn't changed. This can significantly reduce the number of requests to external services. Use a library like `express-response-cache` or build a custom cache mechanism.
   - If the responses from the AI APIs are large, consider setting a maximum response size (e.g., using `res.set('Content-Length', maxSize)`) to prevent potential memory issues on the server side.

3. **Security Issues**:
   - Ensure that you handle errors gracefully and securely when dealing with user input. The current implementation only checks for the presence of a query parameter; however, it does not validate or sanitize the data received. Consider using libraries like `express-validator` to perform input validation.
   - Rotate API keys periodically and never hardcode them directly into your code. Store them securely in environment variables or use key management services like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault.
   - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce the use of HTTPS on your application. You can do this by setting the `Strict-Transport-Security` response header.

4. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Add clear and concise documentation for each API endpoint, including its purpose, input parameters, response format, and any error conditions. This helps developers understand how to use your application more easily. Consider using a tool like Swagger or Postman for this.
   - Document the assumed lifetimes of the AI API keys and provide instructions on how to rotate them securely when necessary.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**:
   - Extract common functionality, such as making AI API calls, into reusable functions to make your code more maintainable and easier to test. This also helps avoid duplicate code across your endpoints.
   - Consider using a centralized error handling mechanism for managing all types of errors (e.g., business logic errors, API errors) rather than having separate catch blocks in each endpoint. This can help ensure consistency in error handling throughout the application.
   - Separate configuration settings like API keys and other environment variables into individual files to make it easier to manage and deploy different environments (dev, staging, prod). You can use tools like `dotenv-safe` or `dotenv-flow` for this purpose.
