## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all API calls instead of mixing with `Promise.allSettled()`. This simplifies the error handling.
   - Consider using a linting tool like ESLint to enforce consistent coding style and catch potential errors early.
   - Add type annotations for function parameters and return types to improve code readability and type safety.
   - Use `process.nextTick()` instead of callbacks for non-blocking tasks within the event loop, as it performs faster than traditional setImmediate or setTimeout functions.
   - Separate configuration from code by creating a separate file for API keys and environment variables.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache API responses if possible to reduce the number of requests made to external services. Implementing a simple cache layer can help improve performance.
   - Use gzip compression for JSON responses to reduce the size of data sent over the network. This can be done using Express's built-in middleware: `app.use(compression());`
   - If your server has a high request volume, consider adding a load balancer and multiple instances of your application to distribute traffic evenly and improve responsiveness.

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs (query parameters) to prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting attacks.
   - Implement proper input validation for AI API keys to ensure only authorized users can access the services.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication between the client and server.
   - Rotate API keys periodically to minimize the risk of unauthorized access in case a key is compromised.
   - Store sensitive information like API keys securely, such as encrypted or in an environment variable manager like `dotenv`.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write detailed documentation for your API endpoints, including expected input formats, return types, and examples of usage.
   - Include a list of valid values for the AI parameter in the error response when the value is invalid.
   - Clearly explain how to authenticate and obtain API keys for each integrated AI service.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract utility functions (e.g., `fetchApi`) that make HTTP requests and pass in the specific API details as parameters, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
   - Create a class or module for handling the AI Bridge logic, allowing you to isolate and test the different components of your application independently.
   - Implement middleware functions for validating user inputs and applying rate limits to help with error handling and performance optimizations.
   - Use a logging library like Winston to centralize logging within your application, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot issues.
