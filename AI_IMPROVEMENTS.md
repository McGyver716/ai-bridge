## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions following camelCase or snake_case. For example, `callOpenAI` could be renamed to `callOpenAi`.
   - Add comments explaining the purpose of complex sections of code, especially when dealing with third-party APIs.
   - Consider using ES6 modules instead of CommonJS for better tree shaking and smaller bundles. However, this might not be applicable if you are targeting a specific environment that does not support ES6 modules.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Caching API responses can significantly improve performance, especially for repeated requests. Implement caching strategies based on the use case and data freshness requirements.
   - Use `async/await` instead of `promises.allSettled()` to handle multiple API calls concurrently, as it is more readable and easier to manage errors.

3. Security Issues:
   - Always validate user input before using it in API requests to prevent potential injection attacks. In this case, consider validating the `query` parameter.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all API endpoints. You can enforce this by configuring Express's `https` module and modifying the API endpoint URLs accordingly.
   - Rotate API keys periodically to minimize the impact of key leaks or compromises.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Include a README file describing the project, its purpose, dependencies, setup instructions, and usage examples.
   - Document any assumptions made during development, known limitations, and future plans for the project.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to contribute to the project (if applicable).

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Move AI API integration functions into a separate module to improve modularity, maintainability, and testability.
   - Consider using an HTTP client like Axios instead of the built-in `fetch` function for more flexibility and better error handling.
   - Implement middleware for logging requests and responses for debugging and auditing purposes.
   - Add proper error handling throughout the application, including custom error classes and response formats.
