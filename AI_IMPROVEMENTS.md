## server.js
 I've analyzed your server.js file and identified several areas where improvements can be made in terms of code quality, performance, security, documentation, and refactoring opportunities. Here are my suggestions:

1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all your fetch calls to make the code more readable and easier to reason about.
   - Consider using a linting tool like ESLint with Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide or a similar standard to enforce consistent coding practices across the project.
   - Organize your functions in modules and export them, making it easier for others to understand and use your codebase.

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching results from AI APIs could significantly improve performance if responses are expected to be consistent over a short period. Implementing caching at the server-side or using a service like Redis could be beneficial.
   - Profiling your code and optimizing hotspots can help ensure that the application performs well under load. Tools like Node.js built-in profiler, `--inspect` flag for Chrome DevTools, or New Relic can help with this.

3. **Security Issues**
   - It's great that you are using helmet and rate limiting middleware to secure your server. However, ensure all sensitive data (like API keys) are stored securely, not in plain text files or environment variables accessible in the codebase. Consider using a secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager or Hashicorp Vault for this purpose.
   - Validate input data from clients to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). You can use libraries like express-validator to help with this.
   - Ensure your dependencies are up-to-date and that there are no known vulnerabilities in them. You can check for updates using `npm outdated` command, and stay informed about security advisories by following their respective GitHub repositories or newsletters.

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add comments to your functions describing what they do and any assumptions made. This will help other developers understand your code more quickly.
   - Create a README file that explains the project's purpose, installation instructions, how to run the application, API documentation, and any other relevant information.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Extract a common function for handling AI API calls so that you don't have to duplicate the fetch logic across different functions. This will make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
   - Consider using a middleware for error handling instead of hardcoding individual errors in your API responses. This can help centralize error handling and make it easier to add custom error handling logic.
   - Create an interface or abstract class for the AI APIs so that you can easily swap out different implementations without modifying the main application code. This will allow you to experiment with multiple AI services without making significant changes to your codebase.
