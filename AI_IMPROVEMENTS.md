## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow consistent coding style guidelines (e.g., airbnb, standard). You can use ESLint for enforcing the rules.
   - Add a `package.json` script to start the server using `node server.js`. For example:
     ```
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node server.js"
     }
     ```
   - Use named imports instead of default ones, it makes code easier to understand and less prone to errors.
   - Use async/await for all promises in try-catch blocks to avoid callback hell and improve readability.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Consider using a library like `morgan` for logging requests for better performance insights.
   - If the responses from AI APIs are large, consider implementing response compression (e.g., gzip).
   - Cache API results (if possible) to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance.

3. Security Issues:
   - Handle errors thrown by AI APIs more gracefully. For example, if an error occurs during an API call, don't return sensitive information like the original query or error message. Instead, log the error and return a generic error response.
   - Validate user inputs (e.g., query parameter) to prevent potential security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks.
   - Add HSTS to your server configuration to enforce HTTPS connections.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write clear and concise comments explaining the purpose of functions, modules, and variables.
   - Include usage examples for API endpoints in the README file or documentation.
   - Write tests for each function and endpoint to ensure correct behavior.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Move AI API calls into separate modules (e.g., `openai.js`, `grok.js`, `claude.js`) to improve modularity, testability, and maintainability.
   - Use middleware for handling logging and rate limiting instead of doing it directly in the main application file. This would make it easier to swap out different logging/rate limiting solutions as needed.
   - Consider using a server framework like NestJS or Express-TS for better TypeScript support and improved developer experience.
