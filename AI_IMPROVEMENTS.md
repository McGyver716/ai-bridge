## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Follow a consistent coding style throughout the file (e.g., using Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide).
   - Add comments to functions and complex logic to improve readability.
   - Use async/await consistently for all fetch calls and error handling.
   - Consider using ESLint with a popular config like Airbnb, Prettier, and Husky for formatting, linting, and automated testing.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Minimize the usage of JSON.stringify()/JSON.parse() as they are expensive operations. Instead, use built-in objects like Date and RegExp directly in requests and responses.
   - Use a library like `serverless-offline` for offline testing and debugging during development to improve performance.
   - Limit the maximum token count per AI API call if possible to reduce latency and costs.
   - Implement response caching based on request parameters for faster response times.

3. Security Issues:
   - Inspect API keys stored in `.env` file and make sure they are properly secured, e.g., using environment variables that are not exposed in the Git repository or other public places.
   - Consider rate limiting individual AI API calls to avoid overloading any single service and ensure fair usage across users.
   - Sanitize user inputs to prevent potential attack vectors like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Implement proper input validation for the query parameter and API key parameters to secure against malicious attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add detailed documentation for the API, including endpoints, request/response examples, authentication requirements, error codes, and response formats.
   - Include a guide on how to obtain and use API keys for each AI service provider.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into separate modules (e.g., utility functions for making API calls).
   - Use middleware to handle common tasks like logging, error handling, and rate limiting.
   - Separate the codebase into smaller components or services if necessary to improve maintainability and scalability.
   - Consider implementing a microservices architecture with separate services for each AI provider if the current setup becomes too complex or resource-intensive.
