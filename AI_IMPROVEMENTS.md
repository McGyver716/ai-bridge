## server.js
 1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
   - Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide (<https://github.com/airbnb/javascript>) for consistent coding style.
   - Use `async/await` consistently within your controller functions.
   - Consider using ESLint with an appropriate configuration to enforce code quality rules and style guide recommendations.
   - Make sure to handle errors properly by either catching them or letting them propagate (not relying on the default error handling provided by Express).

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Cache responses from AI APIs when possible, as they can be slow and expensive. Implement an in-memory cache using a library like `memoizee` (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoizee>).
   - Use gzip compression for your server's responses by adding the following middleware: `app.use(compression());`
   - Optimize JSON responses by using `res.json({ key: value })` instead of setting properties directly on the response object (e.g., `res.json({ success: true, ... })`).

3. **Security Issues**
   - Inspect the AI API keys stored in environment variables to make sure they are properly encrypted or stored securely, as they may contain sensitive information.
   - Consider using a library like `hapi-auth-cookie` (<https://github.com/hapijs/hapi-auth-cookie>) for authentication and authorization purposes. This can help protect your API from unauthorized access.
   - Validate user inputs, especially the `query` parameter, to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Use a library like `express-session` (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session>) for managing user sessions and storing temporary data on the server.

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Create clear and concise documentation for your API, including examples of valid requests and responses, as well as any rate limits or other important information for users consuming the API.
   - Document all dependencies (e.g., express, cors, helmet, etc.) to ensure that others can easily set up and run your server correctly.
   - Include a README file describing how to install and run the application, as well as any important configuration details or environment variables required.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Consider separating AI API calls into their own module, making it easier to test them individually and potentially reuse them in other parts of the application.
   - Create a custom error class for handling errors and providing more descriptive information about the issue that occurred. This can help make debugging easier and provide a better user experience.
   - Implement middleware for handling CORS, rate limiting, and helmet security features to keep your server secure and scalable as traffic grows.
   - Consider using TypeScript for enhanced type checking and better tooling support (e.g., autocompletion, code navigation).
