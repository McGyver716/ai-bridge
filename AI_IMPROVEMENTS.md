## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use `async/await` consistently for all API calls to improve readability and avoid callback hell.
   - Utilize ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style and catch potential errors early. You can create a .eslintrc.json file with rules defined in Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
   - Consider using the `const` keyword for all variables unless there is a specific reason not to do so.
   - Use descriptive variable and function names for better readability.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache API responses if possible, as these AI APIs may have slow response times. You can use libraries like `Redis` or `Memcached` for caching.
   - Enable gzip compression to reduce the size of the sent and received data. Add the following code in your server.js:
     ```
     app.use(compression());
     ```
     And install the compression package with `npm i compression`.

3. Security Issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication between client and server.
   - Validate user input to prevent potential attacks like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Implement HMAC or JWT authentication if the API needs to be protected from unauthorized access.
   - Consider using tools like OWASP ZAP for security testing of your application.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add detailed comments and documentation for each function, explaining its purpose, usage, and any potential edge cases.
   - Include API documentation with examples for the `/ai-bridge` and `/health` endpoints. Use a tool like Swagger (OpenAPI Specification) to create and document your APIs. You can find more information here: https://swagger.io/.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Separate each API integration (OpenAI, Grok, Claude) into individual modules for better organization and reusability.
   - Create a separate middleware function for rate limiting to make it easier to configure and manage.
   - Consider using a logging library like Winston to handle logging in a more structured way: https://github.com/winstonjs/winston.
