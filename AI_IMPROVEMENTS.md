## server.js
 I will provide suggestions for each category you mentioned:

1. **Code Quality and Best Practices**
   - Use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style and catch potential issues early. Install it by running `npm install eslint --save-dev`. Configure it using a popular style guide like Airbnb or Google's JavaScript Style Guide.
   - Consider using TypeScript for better type safety and IDE support. It can help catch some runtime errors at compile time.

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Minimize the number of API calls to improve performance. If possible, cache the responses from AI APIs locally or use a distributed caching system like Redis.
   - Enable gzip compression for JSON responses using middleware like `compression`: `app.use(compression())`. This can help reduce the size of data sent over the network.

3. **Security Issues**
   - In your current implementation, API keys are hardcoded in environment variables, which is a security concern. Consider using secrets management solutions like Hashicorp's Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage sensitive information.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all communications by requiring an SSL certificate: `const https = require('https');` and update the API calls accordingly. This will help encrypt data in transit, providing an additional layer of security.
   - Sanitize user input (query) to prevent potential attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). You can use libraries like `express-sanitizer`.

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add clear and concise comments explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage of each part of the codebase. This will help others understand your work more easily.
   - Write detailed README file covering project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and available endpoints with their parameters.
   - Maintain a CHANGELOG documenting all changes made to the project over time.

5. **Refactoring Opportunities**
   - Extract functions responsible for setting up middleware like helmet, cors, rate limiting, and JSON parsing into separate modules. This will make your server configuration more organized and easier to manage.
   - Use async/await wherever possible for a cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
   - Consider separating the logic for handling AI API calls into a dedicated module. This will improve modularity and maintainability of the application.
