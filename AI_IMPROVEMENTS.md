## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use ES6 module syntax instead of CommonJS for better modularity and tree-shaking. This can be done by changing `const` to `import`. However, it requires updating the server dependencies.
   - Follow a consistent coding style throughout the file (e.g., using single quotes for strings). You may consider using an ESLint config like Airbnb or Google JavaScript Style Guide.
   - Add comments and documentation to functions explaining their purpose and any edge cases they handle. This will help other developers understand the code more easily.
   - Use descriptive variable names instead of abbreviations (e.g., `results` instead of `res`).
   - Consider using async/await for a cleaner, easier-to-read promise handling in the main Bridge Endpoint function.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Cache the API key variables at the top level to avoid frequent reads from the .env file (e.g., `const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`).
   - Consider using a caching library like Redis to store responses from the AI APIs and reduce the number of requests made, especially if the API has a rate limit or slow response times.
   - Use `try-catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully in the main Bridge Endpoint function instead of returning an error object directly in the response (though this is better than crashing the server).

3. Security Issues:
   - Ensure that you are using the latest versions of your dependencies, as outdated packages may contain vulnerabilities. You can use tools like Snyk or Dependabot for automatic dependency updates and security checks.
   - Consider using HTTPS instead of HTTP to secure communications between your server and the AI APIs. This requires purchasing an SSL certificate and updating your server configuration accordingly.
   - Validate user inputs thoroughly, especially if this server will be exposed to the public. In your current code, you're checking for required parameters but not validating their formats or content. Using a library like express-validator can help with input validation.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add documentation for the API, including the available endpoints, request/response format, and any required headers or authentication methods. This can be done using tools like Swagger or Postman.
   - Update the README file to provide instructions on how to run the server, any required dependencies, and any known issues or limitations.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common API call functionality into reusable functions (e.g., a function that takes an AI service as an argument and makes the request). This can help reduce duplicated code and make your code more maintainable.
   - Consider separating the health check endpoint into its own file or module, as it doesn't depend on any other parts of the server. This can improve modularity and testability.
   - If you plan to add more AI services in the future, consider abstracting the calls into a separate service layer, which can be easily extended with new services.
