## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use consistent coding style throughout the codebase. Consider using a linter like ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style.
   - Add comments to explain complex or less obvious parts of the code. This will make it easier for others (or future you) to understand what's happening.
   - Use descriptive variable names and function names that accurately reflect their purpose.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Minimize HTTP requests by combining multiple API calls if possible. This can reduce network latency and improve performance.
   - Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data to decrease the number of API calls and reduce server load.
   - Consider using a library like request-promise-native or axios for handling HTTP requests, as they offer more features for optimizing request handling.

3. Security Issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - Validate user inputs (query parameter) on the server-side to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to help mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write comprehensive documentation for the API, including endpoints, request and response formats, and any necessary authentication requirements.
   - Provide examples of how to use the API effectively, including sample requests and responses.
   - Create a README file that briefly describes the project's purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contributions guide.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract common functionality into separate modules or functions for better code organization and reusability.
   - Use async/await instead of Promises for a cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
   - Consider using TypeScript to add static types, which can help catch errors at compile-time instead of runtime.
