## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Use ES6 import syntax for a cleaner and more modern codebase:
     ```javascript
     import express from 'express';
     import cors from 'cors';
     import helmet from 'helmet';
     import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
     require('dotenv').config();
     ```
   - Add error handling for the `fetch` calls in AI API Integrations functions:
     Currently, if any of the APIs return an error, the error is swallowed and not handled. It would be better to throw the error so it can be caught by a global error handler or logged.
   - Use async/await with fetch instead of callbacks for easier readability and more concise code.
   - Add type definitions using TypeScript to improve type safety and IDE autocompletion.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Enable gzip compression middleware for smaller response sizes and faster loading times. You can use `compression` package to do this.
   - Use a CDN or edge caching service to speed up API responses, especially if the AI Bridge is expected to receive a high volume of requests.

3. Security Issues:
   - Validate input data on all endpoints to prevent SQL injection and other attacks. You can use packages like `express-validator` for this.
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt communication between clients and the server.
   - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to enforce HTTPS connections.
   - Use secure cookies if session management is implemented.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add documentation for all endpoints, including API key usage, available parameters, response formats, and error codes.
   - Create a README file with installation instructions, usage examples, and contributors guide.
   - Include a CONTRIBUTING.md file to outline the coding standards, testing, and other development guidelines.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Extract utility functions (e.g., fetch wrapper for API calls) to improve code organization and reusability.
   - Create a separate configuration file for constants like API keys and app port number.
   - Consider using a logging library like `winston` or `pino` instead of plain console.log statements.
   - Use a dependency management tool like Lerna if there are multiple microservices or packages involved in the project.
   - Implement request rate limiting on individual AI API calls, not just at the server level.
