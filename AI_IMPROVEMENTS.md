## server.js
 1. Code Quality and Best Practices:
   - Modularize your code to break down the functions into smaller modules or files for better organization and maintainability. This includes separating the AI API calls, error handling, and middleware configurations.
   - Use named exports instead of default exports when creating modules. It helps avoid naming conflicts and makes it easier to import specific functions.
   - Implement ESLint for consistent coding style and catch potential errors early. You can configure it using a popular preset like Airbnb or Standard, and add rules specifically tailored to your project.
   - Document your code with clear comments and JSDocs, especially for complex functions and modules. This will help other developers understand the purpose of your code more easily.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Profile your application using tools like Chrome DevTools or Node.js built-in profiling to identify any performance bottlenecks in your code. Address those issues by optimizing loops, reducing function call overhead, and minimizing unnecessary object creations.
   - Consider implementing caching strategies for frequent API calls to improve response times. Caching could be implemented at various levels such as in-memory caching or database caching.

3. Security Issues:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP to secure the communication between the client and server. You can use Let's Encrypt to obtain a free SSL certificate easily.
   - Validate user inputs thoroughly to protect against potential attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Command Injection. Use libraries such as Express-validator for validation.
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further enhance security by restricting the types of content that can be loaded in your application.
   - Sanitize user inputs before using them in any database queries to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
   - Store sensitive data like API keys securely using environment variables or config files not committed to version control systems.

4. Documentation Improvements:
   - Write clear, concise documentation for your server, including its purpose, requirements, and usage. This will help other developers understand how to use your server more easily.
   - Include examples of API usage in the documentation, demonstrating correct request formats and expected responses.
   - Update the README file with a brief explanation of the project, installation instructions, and available endpoints.

5. Refactoring Opportunities:
   - Use async/await instead of promises for simpler and more readable asynchronous code.
   - Extract common error handling logic into separate functions or middleware to avoid duplication.
   - Consider using a framework like Nest.js for better structure, organization, and built-in features like dependency injection and CLI tooling. This can help you build larger applications more efficiently.
